This a restaurant reservation application created with the intent to keep user-friendly, organized reservations and table assignments. This was designed with the business perspective in mind, with the ability to create, edit, and cancel reservations, as well as creating and removing tables. Reservations can be assigned to specific tables. Reservations are listed by specified date, defaulting to the current date on the dashboard. There are buttons to toggle the date to view reservations past, present, and future.

This is a full-stack application built using React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, CSS Bootstrap, Express, Node, Knex, and PostgreSQL. The API was built following RESTful API principles and is constructed to be predictable and resource-oriented. 

This project was deployed as a monorepo using Heroku CLI.

This project was a great exercise is utilizing kanban boards and user stories to organize and develop a full-stack application following an inside-out developement process. This was my first full-stack project, and I have future aspirations to further develop the CSS and styling, as well as to implement more middleware functions and tests to avoid potential user errors.
